# Spinnaker Custom Banners

[Spinnaker](https://www.spinnaker.io) supports a concept of "custom banners" for each application.
At Netflix, we've used this feature for easter eggs and just making life a little more fun.
These are the Netflix custom banners for the Spinnaker microservices themselves, which you can feel free to copy into your own installation.
